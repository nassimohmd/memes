Disclaimer: What I think or believe can be entirely wrong

I've always felt the notion 'suffering makes you grow' as unfair.

I believe anyone can attain enlightenment. Suffering is not a prerequisite for enlightenment. Suffering pushes you off the roof, so either you die or you change. That change is what causes enlightenment.

Most of the people will be unaware of the fact that you're on a roof, some people discover this by change. But for the rest of the people I believe, if you come across this information; that is 'you' are on a 'roof'. You have the choice to take the leap and jump of the roof.

As you might have guessed it. It takes great courage and effort to jump unlike the people who are pushed out by suffering. It is most certainly is painful but still, better than falling off, here you'll be equipped. The jump will tear apart your mental models. That's why religion exist! It's a safety net, but it blinds you from the truth.
