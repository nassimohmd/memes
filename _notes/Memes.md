causal relation between meme censorship and replicability is known as the Streisand effect. It was named after the American actress who tried to hide a picture of her house only to draw greater attention to it. The Streisand effect is **a name for the phenomenon in which attempts to hide, censor, or prevent access to something have the opposite result**—the unintended consequence of drawing far more attention to that thing

Once people become aware something is being kept from them, the motivation to find out skyrockets and the story explodes. Where central state control of print, radio and tv used to make it hard for forbidden memes to spread at scale, there is no stopping the billions of decentralized smart devices transmitting bits at the speed of light. Once the genie is out of the bottle, it can't be put back in.

The Streisand effect is perhaps the best demonstration of how memes are autonomous gene-like entities immune from human control.

religions evolved from worshipping many Gods to just one. The common argument is that people came to recognise their many gods as expressions of the same divine unity. The story of one all-unifying divine force not only makes sense to the human psyche, it is also more scalable in oral lore. **One grand [[story]] is easier to tell, remember and retell than a multitude of smaller ones and so it comes out on top in memetic competition.** Over time, the many god stories organically converged into one.

-   **When memes dictate what we should and shouldn't do, they invent culture.**
-   **When memes imagine better ways to get more with less, they invent technology.**

Cultures and technologies engineered human societies away from nature and its dangers. More and more, new generations were born into worlds of memes rather than of predators and prey. Rather than minds having ideas, ideas have minds. **Cultures self-perpetuate through minds by programming them as they grow up within their values.** Memes around us instruct how to map the world and replicate through our behavior as we act accordingly.

Minds produce memes through self-expression. Minds consume memes through attention.
