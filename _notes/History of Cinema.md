In 1820, there was a dinner party. Mathematician Charles Babbage (the father of computer) was there with astronomer William Herschel (The guy who found  the Uranus).  Herschel asked Babbage a question. how can you see a two sides of the coin at same time. He answered his question by spinning the coin. the both sides blend together

This idea got to hands of a Iirish dr, William Hentry Fitton. he created this

# Scientific explanation of the Illusion
Our brain sees longer than the eye does. this is what called [[Persistance of vision]].

[[Aristotle]], Ptolemy has pondered about this illusion when they saw lighting last even after it end
Ibn Al-Haythan, Arab mathematician saw flickering flames seemed to appear where it was before
[[Leonardo Da Vinci]] and [[Isaac Newton]] devoted their time pondering this mystery
They came to believe that the light that enters into our eyes temporarily burn into our eyes, then automatically wipe it and burn next image
   In 1755, An Irish mathematician Patrick d'Arcy, calculated the velocity required to perceive a spinning light on wire as a large glowing circle. It was **130ms**.
The came the theory that eye acts like a [[camera]]

## Apparent Motion
It's our brain fooling you, not your eyes. but why our brain make stories that don't exists?
If you see bird flying behind trees, our brain instinctively know it is still there and it is the same bird that fly off from the other end of tree. see why stories exist? this phenomenon called [[Object permanance]]. our brain calculate on the vision and come to conclusion that it is indeed, the same bird.  Snake game is not a snake moving, it's just large pixels turning off and on. it's the [[Object permanance]] that makes us perceive it as a Snake. 

### Our brain calculate backwards and write a story that never happened
David Eagleman coined a term for this, *Postdiction*
That means, the brain collects all the information about a scene before it retrospectively says what it think it saw. you're living probably microsecond behind in the past. So when you think the moment 'now' occurs, It's already happened a long time ago. REALITY?

Our brain actually senses the flicker most of the time, but to perceive things clearly. the brain smooth out the information you just saw. that might explain why sometime you can sense the light flickering momentarily.

Imagine you're born into a dark cabin without any outside exposure, all you get is limited descriptions of what's outside. like how does a sky look like, how does a cat look like. if someone told to draw what's outside, you would draw a reality with limited information you got. your brain create stories with the limited information it get
**When you watch a movie, it's not the filmmakers or actors making the stories, it's your brain**

A YOUTUBE COMMENT - 
*I've always been fascinated by the concept of how our movies would be seen by beings, like certain animals or even extraterrestrials that process visual information slightly differently. Would they even be able to visually comprehend a movie, or would it appear as a garbled mess to them?
